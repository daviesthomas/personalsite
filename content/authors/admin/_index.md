Hi. I'm Tom. I like to work on large technical projects, creating practical solutions from ambiguos (and fluid) requirements, converting messy and chaotic technical landscapes to clean systems, and taking R&D projects all the way from conception to shipment.

I'm currently working as a Sr. Research Engineer at Autodesk while pursuing my interests in computer graphics through a research based masters in computer science at UofT under <a href=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson> Alec Jacobson </a>. 

At Autodesk I work as a Sr. Machine Learning researcher focused on exploring how emerging research in Deep Learning can be applied to solve our customers problems. I've successfully deployed three ML features, act as tech manager leading 4 developers, and have two patents. 

My research masters with Alec Jacobson initially revolved around overfitting neural networks to geometries implicit functions as a compact shape representation (it was alot of fun, here's the paper: ). Now I'm interested in exploring approaches to simplify the process of creative 3D design, currently focused on intuitive sketch to 3D interfaces to help and guide users to viable design options (this is also fun). 

I play soccer and volleyball. Love to hike and camp. Read Sci-fi. Eat good food. And Hope to one day own a dog.
